Abstract:

Aims. We present a new estimate of the multiplicity fraction of M-Dwarfs using a log-normal fit to the orbital surface density distribution.
Methods. We used point estimates of multiplicity from five M-Dwarf surveys sampling distinct orbital radii to fit a log-normal
function to the orbital surface density distribution of these stars. This model, alongside the companion mass ratio distribution given
by Reggiani and Meyer (2013), was used to calculate the frequency of companions over the ranges of mass ratio (q) and semi-major
axis (a) that the referenced surveys were collectively sensitive over - [0.60  q  1.00] and [0.00  a  10,000 AU]. This method was
then extrapolated to calculate a multiplicity fraction which encompasses the broader ranges of [0.10  q  1.00] and [0.00  a < 1
AU]. Finally, the results of these calculations were compared to the multiplicity fractions of other spectral types of stars.
Results. The multiplicity fraction over the constrained regions of [0.60 < q < 1.00] and [0.00  a  10,000 AU] was found to be
0.239  0.040. The extrapolated multiplicity fraction over the broader ranges of q (0.10 - 1.00) and a (0.00 - 1 AU) was calculated as
0.481  0.129. Lastly, the multiplicity of M-Dwarfs is similar to that of FGK and A stars over the constrained regions of mass ratio
and semi-major axis.

"Multiplicity Project - Analysis.ipynb" is the main file of this project. In this notebook, I describe the context of this work, fit the model, and calculate resulting implications. 
"Multiplicity Project - Data.ipynb" is the file in which I import and clean the data for this project. The outputs of this work are saved in "derived_data.py"
The "Results" folder contains the most recent draft of the paper and poster that accompany this project. The paper, "M-Dwarf Multiplicity.pdf" is a good place to go to get a complete idea of the work done here.

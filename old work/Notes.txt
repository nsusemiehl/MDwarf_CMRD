microlensing (Shvartzvald et. al. 2016)
	section 5
	8% of lens stars have stellar companions with separation .5<s<2	
	look at q completion - default to primary mass = mean m dwarf mass, secondary = HBL 
	add as sixth data point
	convert s to separation (check 404 book)

use chi^2 fit instead of my shitty method (check 361 notes)
should be between 1 and 2

compare to winters, do not use winters data
